> How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
>
>> I feel pretty confident with the arrays themselves, but not yet so much with the methods. I am sure more practice is going to help out there. But also i know that i do not have to memorize them all if i know where to find them.

> Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
>
>> I think i am going to poke around with a few more method replits

> What questions do you have about Arrays?
>
>> While i was able to complete the work, i do not really understand how the boolean arrays are meant to work (on their own). Maybe for like determining a prefilled for or checklist? i suppose i will look into this some more.
